### How to contribute?
to add your own vimrc, first you should fork this repository and clone it to your desktop. then create a folder and name it your username (e.g. my username is mr0null, then I have created folder `mr0null`) and copy your vimrc to that folder and make it viewable (if you are in mac or linux, it may be hidden!) and make sure it is named vimrc. to make using it easy for other, create a `readme.md` file in directory you created, and then describe what it does and how it works. finally you need to just send pull request to me and if everything was ok with that, I will accept that pull request!
